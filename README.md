## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

Using the NASA API, I was able to fetch data and display a photo or video taken from a desired date. 

## Optimizations

Some of the images/video can take awhile to render on the page, so I would like to find a way to optimize this process and see if there's a way to compress those files before uploading them to the page.

## Lessons Learned:

I learned a method of updating the DOM in order for videos and images to be dispalyed depending on the data that was retrived from the API. By making one hidden while the other is shown, I was able to keep the display clean and user friendly. 

## Examples:
Take a look at these couple examples that I have in my own portfolio:
